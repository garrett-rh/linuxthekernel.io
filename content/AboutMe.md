# About Me

I started my career in the IT/Software Engineering field as a SysAdmin/DevOps Engineer for Heron Systems in support of their contribution to the [Alpha Dog Fight Trials hosted by DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_AlphaDogfight).

 In this role, I helped maintain our private cloud infrastructure and eventually assisted in the switch over to a full on-prem Kubernetes deployment for AI training. During that time, Heron Systems was acquired by Shield AI. I bounced across a few different teams at Shield AI before I eventually joined the Developer Experience/Productivity team. On this team, I helped bridge the gap between our dedicated DevOps teams and our Engineering teams. This included everything from being an advocate for developer productivity, setting up cloud infrastructure, and writing internal software tooling for our engineering teams. Nowadays, I am working on a defense contract in support of [the DTRA Red Team](https://www.onevaliant.com/news/defense-threat-reduction-agency-awards-valiant-%2418m-task-order-to-provide-advance-cyber-support-and-operations-to-department-of-defense-assessment-team).

Outside of work, I enjoy staying away from computers as much as possible. I try to keep my interests pretty diverse so I can be found reading, fishing, lifting, working on my truck, or hanging out with my cats. Despite my efforts, I usually end up back on my computer gaming or working on another software project that I'll eventually scrap. Overall, I hope to keep this blog as a healthy combination of computer related topics as well as everything else I do. Enjoy!
